### Hi there ðŸ‘¯

My name is Soraya and I'm a Spanish front-end developer jr specializing in JavaScript, React, UI design (HTML5 & CSS3, Sass, etc.) and API integration.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for an exciting opportunity to work in and grow! 

Some of my projects:
- âœº [Rick & Morty app](https://github.com/sorayav/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-sorayav): a responsive web application developed with React (and React Router), external API integration and out of this world ðŸ‘¾ UI.
- âœº [Relax app](https://github.com/sorayav/relax-app): an application to take a moment to breath ðŸ˜². Built with JavaScript vanilla and using Vibrate and Share web APIs for mobile. Open the music player to be accompanied by a tranquil song while you breath.
- âœº [Neumorphic clock](https://github.com/sorayav/js-clock): a clock coded with JavaScript and designed under the neumorphism style. UX experiment.
- âœº [TV shows app](https://github.com/sorayav/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-sorayav): JavaScript application to find tv shows, their information and add / remove them as favourites. API and localStorage implementation.
